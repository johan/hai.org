# HAI Global Anti-Harassment and Inappropriate Sexual Behavior Policy
HAI Global (HAI) strives to create and maintain an environment in which people are treated in accordance with our values: Respect, Kindness, Integrity, Curiosity, and Humility. The workshop environment should be characterized by consent and the absence of intimidation, oppression and exploitation. HAI Global will not tolerate unlawful harassment of any kind. HAI Global strongly encourages anyone who feels they have experienced a violation, harassment, and/or breach of consent at a HAI event to take immediate action.

If the person is willing and able, they are encouraged to raise the issue with the other person(s) directly involved, with a view to resolving the issue. If possible, the person should identify the offensive behavior, explain that the behavior is unwelcome and offensive and ask that the behavior stop. This can be done with the support of a Facilitator, Producer, or other qualified HAI event leader. HAI is a strong advocate for consent, and has published our HAI Standards for Consent.

All BOD, Staff, volunteers and participants are covered by and must comply with this policy and take appropriate measures to ensure that prohibited conduct does not occur. Appropriate action will be taken with any volunteer or participant who violates this policy. Based on the seriousness of the offense, appropriate action may include verbal or written documentation, suspension, removal from the volunteer program or permanent removal from attending HAI events and workshops. See participation agreements (version 1, version 2- clothing optional event version, online version).

Facilitators, volunteers and all leadership at HAI who knowingly allow or tolerate harassment or inappropriate behavior, including the failure to immediately report it to the S&C Office, are in violation of this policy and subject to appropriate action up to and including removal from HAI.

Courteous, mutually respectful, pleasant, noncoercive interactions between participants, including volunteers that are appropriate in workshops and HAI events and acceptable to and welcomed by both parties are not considered to be sexual harassment. Asking permission to touch one another is a standard practice at HAI. Mutual Consent is essential in all situations. If you are unsure, stop what you are doing and ask again.

## Harassment
This policy is intended for all HAI workshops and events (in person and online), not the events that take place outside of formal HAI functions. HAI Global prohibits harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment, and will take appropriate and immediate action in response to complaints or knowledge of violations of this policy. For purposes of this policy, harassment is any verbal or physical conduct which may threaten, intimidate or coerce a participant or volunteer or any person working for or on behalf of HAI Global Programs.

The following examples of harassment are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a violation of this policy:

* Verbal harassment includes comments that are offensive or unwelcome regarding a person’s national origin, race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, body, disability or appearance, including epithets, slurs and negative stereotyping. In addition, any form of aggressive, abusive, or threatening speech or behavior towards others (including: office staff, venue staff, etc.) would be considered a form of harassment.

* Nonverbal harassment includes distribution, display or discussion of any written or graphic material that ridicules, denigrates, insults, belittles or shows hostility, aversion or disrespect toward an individual or group because of national origin, race, color, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, appearance, disability, sexual identity, marital status or other protected status.

* Organizational harassment toward HAI global includes actions such as coercion, embezzlement, financial and reputational attacks, and harassment and bullying of staff and leadership.

Inappropriate sexual behavior may take different forms. The following examples of these behaviors are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a violation of this policy:

* Nonverbal sexual harassment includes the distribution, display or discussion of inappropriate written or graphic material, including calendars, posters and cartoons that are sexually suggestive or show hostility toward an individual or group because of sex; suggestive or insulting sounds; leering; staring; whistling; obscene gestures; content in letters, notes, facsimiles, e-mails, photos, text messages, tweets and Internet postings; or other forms of communication that are sexual in nature and offensive.

* Physical sexual harassment includes unwelcome, unwanted physical contact, including touching, tickling, pinching, patting, brushing up against, hugging, cornering, kissing, fondling, and forced sexual intercourse or assault.

Any person who is found to have violated this aspect of the policy will be subject to discipline up to and including removal from HAI.

## Filing a Report
A report of a violation, harassment, and/or breach of consent can be initiated by any member of the HAI community by completing an online Incident Report Form. They may also report the behavior by contacting a HAI Facilitator, Producer, or Executive Director. Any breach of consent, violation, and/or harassment report will be treated seriously and promptly. Such reports will be treated as confidential to the extent possible. HAI discloses information strictly on a need-to-know basis.

The person harmed should be prepared to provide details such as what happened; when it happened; where it happened; how often and who else was present (if applicable). Reports should be made as soon as possible, unless there are circumstances that prevent the person harmed from doing so. Every effort will be made to resolve reports within 60 days or in accordance with the desires and needs of the person harmed.

## Reviewing an Incident Report
A review of the reported incident will be conducted. The reviewer will interview the person who made the complaint, the person the complaint was made against and any witnesses that have been identified. The reviewer will prepare a report that will include a description of the allegations, the response of the person the complaint was made against, a summary of information learned from witnesses (if applicable), and a recommendation about whether, on a balance of probabilities, a breach of consent, violation, and/or harassment did occur.

## Open-Investigation Policy
When HAI has an open investigation, the respondent (subject) is no longer able to participate or attend workshops, online events or groups, or any other HAI functions during our information gathering time and until a resolution is determined. There may be situations where it’s appropriate for both the complainant and the respondent to be removed pending investigation. The Safety and Consent Council has the authority to make these decisions at its sole discretion.

## Mediation
Wherever appropriate and possible, the parties to the incident report will be offered mediation. Mediation is voluntary and confidential, and will only be shared within the organization on a need-to-know basis. It is intended to assist the parties to arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution to the complaint. The mediator will be a person agreed upon by both parties. Each party to the complaint can be accompanied and assisted during mediation sessions by a person of their choosing.

## Safety & Consent Review of Incident Report
A review of the reported incident will be conducted by the Safety and Consent Office. The reviewer will interview the person who made the complaint, the person the complaint was made against and any witnesses that have been identified. The reviewer will prepare a report that will include a description of the allegations, the response of the person the complaint was made against (respondent), a summary of information learned from witnesses (if applicable), and a recommendation about whether, on a balance of probabilities, a breach of consent, violation, and/or harassment did occur. This report will be submitted to a small executive team that is monitoring all complaints. These reports are not shared outside of HAI.

## Organizational Responses
Remedies for the person who felt harmed may include:

* The option to speak with the person found to have engaged in the harm and to convey the impact of their actions; this can be done with support of somebody of the person’s choice, if desired.

* An acknowledgement of the impact on the person harmed by the person who harmed them.

* An oral or written apology from the person.

* Hearing a commitment from the person that the behavior will not be repeated.

Corrective action for the person found to have harmed may include:

* Education or training

* A note in their HAI employment file (if applicable)

* Coaching or mentorship

* Conditions placed upon their participation in HAI events

* Restriction on attendance at HAI events

* Conditions or restriction on their team member status (if applicable)

* Removal from HAI

## Privacy and Confidentiality
All complaints and investigations are treated confidentially to the extent possible, and information is disclosed strictly on a need-to-know basis as required by law. The identity of the complainant is not always revealed to the parties involved during the investigation, and the Safety and Consent Office will take adequate steps to ensure that the complainant is protected from retaliation during and after the investigation. All information pertaining to a complaint or investigation under this policy will be maintained in secure files.

## Volunteer Agreements, Signed
All volunteers will be required to sign a copy of their agreements once a year while an active volunteer. This will include the Team Agreements that are in place that each volunteer agrees to when they are accepted as a team member. The volunteer will follow the agreements as they are written.

## Final Decisions by S&C
Once a decision has been made by the S&C Officer, the decision is final. Egregious cases result in removal from HAI, while some lesser violations may include a break from HAI. When the result is removal, there is no second chance or “path back to HAI.”

## Leadership Role
Leadership including Producers, Facilitators, FITS, Board Members, Staff, and key volunteers will be accountable to support the actions of the S&C Office.

If leadership is approached by anyone regarding a decision, refer them back to the S&C Office. This will happen even if the leader holds a difference of opinion of that of the investigator. If new information is presented S&C may reconsider. If an escalation is deemed necessary, S&C will refer the matter to the Executive Director and Legal Counsel.(NOTE: The ED is informed of any S&C issues beyond simple participant mediation needs). The next step of escalation is to the full Safety and Consent Council comprising Board, HR, Legal and Executive Positions. Any incident that involves a Facilitator immediately gets escalated to the Executive Director.
