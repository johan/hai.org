# HAI Global Anti-Harassment Policy
This policy is intended for all HAI workshops and events (in person and online), not the events that take place outside of formal HAI functions. It applies to all participants and volunteers. It is your responsibility to be familiar with this policy and to read all pre-workshop, on-line training or event rules and policies prior to attending any HAI event.

HAI Global (HAI) strives to create and maintain an environment in which people are treated in accordance with our values: Respect, Kindness, Integrity, Curiosity, and Humility. The workshop environment should be characterized by consent and the absence of intimidation, oppression and exploitation. HAI Global prohibits harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment, and will take appropriate and immediate action in response to complaints or knowledge of violations of this policy. HAI Global strongly encourages anyone who has experienced a violation, harassment, and/or breach of consent at a HAI event, or feels they may have, to take immediate action.

If the person is willing and able, they are encouraged to raise the issue with the other person(s) directly involved, with a view to resolving the issue. If possible, the person should identify the offensive behavior, explain that the behavior is unwelcome and offensive, and ask that the behavior stop. This can be done with the support of a Facilitator, Producer, or other qualified HAI event leader. HAI is a strong advocate for consent, and has published our HAI Standards for Consent.

All volunteers and participants are covered by and must comply with this policy and take appropriate measures to ensure that prohibited conduct does not occur. Appropriate action will be taken with any volunteer or participant who violates this policy. Facilitators, volunteers and people in authority at HAI who knowingly allow or tolerate harassment or inappropriate behavior, including the failure to immediately report it to the Safety & Consent (S&C) Office, are in violation of this policy. Based on the seriousness of the offense, appropriate action may include verbal or written documentation, suspension, removal from the volunteer program or permanent removal from attending HAI events and workshops. See participation agreements (clothing on event version, clothing optional event version, online version).

Courteous, mutually respectful, pleasant, noncoercive interactions between participants, volunteers and employees that are appropriate in workshops and HAI events and acceptable to and welcomed by all parties are not considered to be sexual harassment. Asking permission to touch one another is a standard practice at HAI. Mutual Consent is essential in all situations. If you are unsure, stop what you are doing and ask again.

## Harassment
For purposes of this policy, harassment is any verbal or physical conduct which may threaten, intimidate or coerce a participant or volunteer or any person working for or on behalf of HAI Global Programs.

The following examples of harassment are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a violation of this policy:

* Verbal harassment includes comments that are offensive or unwelcome regarding a person’s national origin, race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, body, disability or appearance, including epithets, slurs and negative stereotyping. In addition, any form of aggressive, abusive, or threatening speech or behavior towards others (including: office staff, venue staff, etc.) would be considered a form of harassment.

* Nonverbal harassment includes distribution, display or discussion of any written or graphic material that ridicules, denigrates, insults, belittles or shows hostility, aversion or disrespect toward an individual or group because of national origin, race, color, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, appearance, disability, sexual identity, marital status or other protected status.

* Stalking, whether physically or electronically. This includes repeated non-consensual communication, or verbal, written, or implied threats, or a combination thereof, that would cause a reasonable person fear. Stalking behaviors also may include persistent patterns of leaving or sending the victim unwanted items or presents, or following or laying in wait for a person.

Inappropriate sexual behavior may take different forms. The following examples of these behaviors are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a violation of this policy:

* Nonverbal sexual harassment includes the distribution, display or discussion of inappropriate written or graphic material, including calendars, posters and cartoons that are sexually suggestive or show hostility toward an individual or group because of sex; suggestive or insulting sounds; leering; staring; whistling; obscene gestures; content in letters, notes, facsimiles, e-mails, photos, text messages, tweets and Internet postings; or other forms of communication that are sexual in nature and offensive.

* Physical sexual harassment includes unwelcome, unwanted physical contact, including touching, tickling, pinching, patting, brushing up against, hugging, cornering, kissing, fondling, and forced sexual intercourse or assault. It also includes nudity in inappropriate situations such as online and clothing-on events. Nudity at clothing optional events is not in itself sexual harassment.

Any person who is found to have violated this aspect of the policy will be subject to discipline up to and including removal from HAI.

## Filing a Report
A report of a violation, harassment, and/or breach of consent can be initiated by any member of the HAI community by completing an online Incident Report Form. They may also report the behavior by contacting a HAI Facilitator, Producer, or Executive Director. It is critical that each incident be reported to the S&C by filing an incident report; just notifying someone isn’t enough. Any breach of consent, violation, and/or harassment report will be treated seriously and promptly. Such reports will be treated as confidential to the extent possible. HAI discloses information strictly on a need-to-know basis.

The person harmed should be prepared to provide details such as what happened; who it happened with; when it happened; where it happened; how often and who else was present (if applicable). Reports should be made as soon as possible, unless there are circumstances that prevent the person harmed from doing so. Every effort will be made to resolve reports within 60 days or in accordance with the desires and needs of the person harmed.

## Reviewing an Incident Report
A review of the reported incident will be conducted. A Safety and Consent Officer will interview the person who made the complaint (complainant), the person the complaint was made against (respondent), and any witnesses that have been identified. The reviewer will document the outcome in a tracking system that will include a description of the allegations, the response of the respondent, a summary of information learned from witnesses (if applicable), and a recommendation about whether, on a balance of probabilities, a breach of consent, violation, and/or harassment did occur. These reports are not shared outside of HAI.

## Open-Investigation Policy
When HAI has an open investigation, the respondent (subject) is no longer able to participate or attend workshops, online events or groups, or any other HAI functions during our information gathering time and until a resolution is determined. There may be situations where it’s appropriate for both the complainant and the respondent to be removed pending investigation. The Safety and Consent Council has the authority to make these decisions at its sole discretion.

## Mediation
Wherever appropriate and possible, the parties to the incident report will be offered mediation. Mediation is voluntary and confidential, and will only be shared within the organization on a need-to-know basis. It is intended to assist the parties to arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution to the complaint. The mediator will be a person agreed upon by both parties. Each party to the complaint can be accompanied and assisted during mediation sessions by a person of their choosing.

## Organizational Responses
## Remedies for the complainant may include:
* The option to speak with the respondent and to convey the impact of their actions; this can be done with support of somebody of the complainant’s choice, if desired.

* An acknowledgement of the impact on the complainant by the respondent.

* An oral or written apology from the respondent.

* Hearing a commitment from the respondent that the behavior will not be repeated.

Corrective action for the person found to have harmed may include:

* Education or training

* A note in their HAI employment file (if applicable)

* Coaching or mentorship

* Conditions placed upon their participation in HAI events

* Restriction on attendance at HAI events

* Conditions or restriction on their team member status or removal from team (if applicable)

* Removal from HAI

## Privacy and Confidentiality
All complaints and investigations are treated confidentially to the extent possible, and information is disclosed strictly on a need-to-know basis as required by law. The identity of the complainant is not always revealed to the parties involved during the investigation, and the Safety and Consent Office will take adequate steps to ensure that the complainant is protected from retaliation during and after the investigation. All information pertaining to a complaint or investigation under this policy will be maintained in secure files.

## Volunteer Agreements, Signed
All volunteers will be required to sign a copy of their agreements once a year while an active volunteer. This will include the Team Agreements that are in place that each volunteer agrees to when they are accepted as a team member. The volunteer will follow the agreements as they are written.

## Final Decisions by S&C
Once a decision has been made by the S&C Officer, the decision is final. Egregious cases result in removal from HAI, while some lesser violations may include a break from HAI. When the result is removal, there is no second chance or “path back to HAI.”

## Leadership Role
Leadership including Producers, Facilitators, FITS, Board Members, Staff, and key volunteers will be accountable to roll out/enforce the actions of the S&C Office.

If leadership is approached by anyone regarding a decision, they are to refer that person back to the S&C Office. This will happen even if the leader holds a difference of opinion of that of the investigator. If new information is presented S&C may reconsider. If there is an escalation deemed appropriate S&C will refer the matter to the Executive Director and Legal Counsel.

## Board of Director Reporting
The board has access to a report, updated concurrently with the unfolding of each case, which provides an overview of all cases to date without revealing the identities of anyone involved in any case.
